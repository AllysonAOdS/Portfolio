Graduated in Production Engineering back in 2009 at UFRN (Brazil), have been working with data analysis ever since. For more details on my professional carreer, please check my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/allyson-silva-95aa3a22/?locale=en_US).

Originally from Natal, a medium-sized city in the northeast of Brazil. After graduating I moved to São Paulo and after a few years, to Germany where I lived in Dortmund and currently in Düsseldorf.

Besides crunching numbers and building charts, I try to spend my time with friends or learning the violin and piano. Recently I have got back into cycling, mostly during the Summer.

Other interests include languages, cooking, politics, environmental and social issues.
